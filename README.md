## Coding Samples

The page below describes the data used in the three sample codes in this repo, and what the code does.

## Trade Decomposition.R

The main purpose of the code is to implement the decomposition of India's merchandise into three parts: Relative Absorption, Relative Import Intensity, and Terms of Trade. There are two sample visualizations: a periodwise decomposition table showing the contribution of each term, and a graph showing evolution of each component over time.
 

## Text Analysis.R

Using four sample texts written by four classical economists - David Ricardo, Adam Smith, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill, I use three techniques of text analysis
namely, tf-idf and topic modelling to identify common themes across their works. The code extracts the raw book files, cleans them, implements the two techniques,
and visualizes the output.

## Chalfin McCrary Replication.R

I extend the Chalfin- McCrary dataset on police employment and crime (1960-2010), till 2019 to undertake a long replication of their analysis.
The authors identify two sources of data for police employment, UCR and ASG. In this file, I extend the data for both these variables, by cleaning
the raw data, and preparing it for further inference.
