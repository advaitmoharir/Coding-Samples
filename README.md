## Coding Samples

The page below describes the data used in the three sample codes in this repo, and what the code does.

## Decomposition.R

This file deals with macroeconomic data, specifically trade data of India and its trading partners. The main purpose of the code is to implement the decomposition
of the trade ratio into three parts: Relative Absorption, Relative Import Intensity, and Terms of Trade.

## Text Analysis.R

Using four sample texts written by four classical economists - David Ricardo, Adam Smith, Karl Marx and xyz, I use three techniques of text analysis
namely, tf-idf, LDA and xyz to identify common themes across their works. The analysis uses the tidytext package.

## Chalfin McCrary Replication.R

I extend the Chalfin- McCrary dataset on police employment and crime (1960-2010), till 2019 to undertake a long replication of their analysis.
The authirs identify two sources of data for police employment, UCR and ASG. In this file, I extend the data for both these variables, by cleaning
the raw data.
